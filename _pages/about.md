I'm a post-master researcher at ETRI. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Hanyang University, ERICA campus, and my M.S. in Automotive Engineering from Hanyang University, where I was advised by Prof.[Kunsoo Huh](https://archi.hanyang.ac.kr/src/lab_mmc.php). My research interests focus on end-to-end autonomous driving, LLM agents for embodied AI, and vision-language-action alignment.
